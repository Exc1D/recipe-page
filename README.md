## My process

I downloaded the pre-formatted starter code and other necessary files from [frontendmentor.io] which is free by the way. Then I sent the .fig file to [pixso.net] so that I can analyze the properties.

I format the HTML code first then proceed with looking for repetitive CSS attributes. I synthesized these attributes in :root. Styled the rest of the elements then added the final touches of spacing corrections.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use :root pseudo-class to gather the repetitive attributes.

### Useful resources

- [pixso.net]- this app has a free dev mode that can be used to analyze specific CSS properties that were otherwise a paid feature in figma.
